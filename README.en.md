## 📘 Description 🇬🇧

This interactive MATLAB App allows you to evaluate planar stress states using three classical **failure theories**. It is designed for teaching or self-learning in mechanical engineering, solid mechanics, and machine design.

---

## 🧠 Implemented Theories

- **Maximum Normal Stress** (Rankine)  
- **Maximum Shear Stress** (Tresca)  
- **Distortion Energy Theory** (von Mises)

---

## ✨ App Features

- Calculates principal and equivalent stresses  
- Graphical representation of failure envelopes  
- User-friendly and interactive interface  
- Evaluates each criterion based on input stresses  
- Ideal for academic use and practice

---
